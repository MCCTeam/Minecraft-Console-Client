## About

**Minecraft Console Client (MCC)** is a lightweight cross-platform open-source **Minecraft** TUI client for **Java edition** that allows you to connect to any Minecraft Java server, send commands and receive text messages in a fast and easy way without having to open the main Minecraft game.

It also provides various automations that you can enable for administration and other purposes, as well as extensible C# API for creating Bots.

It was originally made by [ORelio](https://github.com/ORelio) in 2012 on the [Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1314800-/), now it's maintained by him and many other contributors from the community.

## Notes on some features

### Inventory, Terrain and Entity Handling

Inventory handling is currently not supported in versions: `1.4.6 - 1.9` (*The inventory handling code is in the place, but we're missing Item Palettes, on which we're working.*)

Terrain handling is currently not supported in versions: `1.4.6 - 1.6`

Entity handling is currently not supported in versions: `1.4.6 - 1.7`

There features might not always be implemented in the latest version of the game, since they're often subjected to major changes by Mojang, and we need some time to figure out what has changed and to implement the required changes.

If there was a major game update, and the MCC hasn't been updated to support these features, if you're a programmer, feel free to contribute to the project.

### Path-Finding and Physics

Currently the path-finding and physics have some limitations, those are:
- Path finding under slabs is not supported (currently being worked on, partialy complete but not avaliable in the main branch)
- Swimming is not supported yet
- Jumping is not supported yet
- Knockback is not supported yet

What is supported and works:
- Terrain navigation (path-finding with A* algorithm and walking)
- Climbing up and down the ladders and all types of vines
- Gravity
