+++++++++++++
CAUTION
+++++++++++++

The bot identifies players by their name (Not by UUID!). A nick plugin 
or a minecraft rename may cause mails going to the wrong player! 
Never write something to the bot you wouldn't say in the normal chat!
(You have been warned!)

+++++++++++++
Mail Network
+++++++++++++

To set up a network of two or more bots you first need to launch
several instances with the bot activated. It works best if all 
instances are launched in the same folder (from the same .exe).
First set the mail path to one file. This path is set relative to
the .exe (e.g. (.exe PATH)\samplefile.txt => changemailpath 
\sample.txt). If you launch two instances from one .exe they 
should syncronize automatically to the same file. If you want 
different settings for each bot, change the option path. REMEMBER
to create subfolder before changing the path. The Bot won't
create folders on its own.
A good interval for the bots would be
(botcount = minutes) and you go to each bot and reset the 
timer after one minute so that each minute one bot synchronize
its data. (Must be done after every restart.)
All settings can be resetted by deleting the safe file.
