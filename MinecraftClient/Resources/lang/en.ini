We are looking forward at improving this.\n# It is recommended to keep the farming area walled off and flat to avoid the bot jumping.\n# Also, if you have your farmland that is one block high, make it 2 or more blocks high so the bot does not fall through, as it can happen sometimes when the bot reconnects.\n# The bot also does not pickup all items if they fly off to the side, we have a plan to implement this option in the future as well as drop off and bonemeal refill chest(s).
