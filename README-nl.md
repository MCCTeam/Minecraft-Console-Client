If you feel like it could be you, please have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awaiting-for%3Acontributor) section :)

## How to contribute üìù

If you'd like to contribute to Minecraft Console Client, great, just fork the repository and submit a pull request on the *Master* branch. MCC is currently distributed as development builds only (which are usually stable) so we no longer use the *Indev* branch.

## Translating Minecraft Console Client üåç

If you would like to translate Minecraft Console Client to a different language, please download the translation file from [the lang folder](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/tree/master/MinecraftClient/Resources/lang) or just fork the repository. Once you finished the translation work, submit a pull request or send us the file through an [Issue](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/issues) in case you are not familiar with Git.

To use the translated language file, place it under `lang/mcc/` folder and set your language in `.ini` config. You may create the directory if does not exist.

For the names of the translation file, please see [this comment](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/pull/1282#issuecomment-711150715).

## License ‚öñÔ∏è

Unless specifically stated, the code is from the MCC Team or Contributors, and available under CDDL-1.0. Else, the license and original author are mentioned in source file headers.
The main terms of the CDDL-1.0 license are basically the following:

- You may use the licensed code in whole or in part in any program you desire, regardless of the license of the program as a whole (or rather, as excluding the code you are borrowing). The program itself may be open or closed source, free or commercial.
- However, in all cases, any modifications, improvements, or additions to the CDDL code (any code that is referenced in direct modifications to the CDDL code is considered an addition to the CDDL code, and so is bound by this requirement; e.g. a modification of a math function to use a fast lookup table makes that table itself an addition to the CDDL code, regardless of whether it's in a source code file of its own) must be made publicly and freely available in source, under the CDDL license itself.
- In any program (source or binary) that uses CDDL code, recognition must be given to the source (either project or author) of the CDDL code. As well, modifications to the CDDL code (which must be distributed as source) may not remove notices indicating the ancestry of the code.
