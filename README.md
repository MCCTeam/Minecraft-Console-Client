Once you finished the translation work, submit a pull request or send us the file through an [Issue](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/issues) in case you are not familiar with Git.

To use the translated language file, place it under `lang/mcc/` folder and set your language in `.ini` config. You may create the directory if it does not exist.

For the names of the translation file, please see [this comment](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/pull/1282#issuecomment-711150715).

## Building from the source üèóÔ∏è

This section has been moved to our new [Documentation website](https://mccteam.github.io/docs/guide/installation.html#building-from-the-source-code).

## License ‚öñÔ∏è

Unless specifically stated, the code is from the MCC Team or Contributors, and available under CDDL-1.0. Else, the license and original author are mentioned in source file headers.
The main terms of the CDDL-1.0 license are basically the following:

-   You may use the licensed code in whole or in part in any program you desire, regardless of the license of the program as a whole (or rather, as excluding the code you are borrowing). The program itself may be open or closed source, free or commercial.
-   However, in all cases, any modifications, improvements, or additions to the CDDL code (any code that is referenced in direct modifications to the CDDL code is considered an addition to the CDDL code, and so is bound by this requirement; e.g. a modification of a math function to use a fast lookup table makes that table itself an addition to the CDDL code, regardless of whether it's in a source code file of its own) must be made publicly and freely available in source, under the CDDL license itself.
-   In any program (source or binary) that uses CDDL code, recognition must be given to the source (either project or author) of the CDDL code. As well, modifications to the CDDL code (which must be distributed as source) may not remove notices indicating the ancestry of the code.
