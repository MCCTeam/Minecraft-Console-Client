name: technique-name
description: >-
  Use when [specific symptom].
metadata:
  category: technique
  triggers: error-text, symptom, tool-name
---

# Technique Name

## Overview

[1-2 sentence core principle]

## When to Use

- [Symptom A]
- [Symptom B]
- [Error message text]

**NOT for:**
- [When to avoid]

## The Problem

// Bad example
function badCode() {
  // problematic pattern
}
\`\`\`

## The Solution

\`\`\`javascript
// Good example
function goodCode() {
  // improved pattern
}
\`\`\`

## Step-by-Step

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]

- Right: \`good code\`
```

## Template: Discipline Skill

For rules that agents must follow. Requires anti-rationalization techniques.

```markdown
---
name: discipline-name
description: >-
  Use when [BEFORE violation].
metadata:
  category: discipline
  triggers: new feature, code change, implementation
---

# Rule Name

## Iron Law

**[SINGLE SENTENCE ABSOLUTE RULE]**

Violating the letter IS violating the spirit.

## The Rule

1. ALWAYS [step 1]
2. NEVER [step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Violations

[Action before rule]? **Delete it. Start over.**

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it
- Delete means delete

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple" | Simple code breaks. Rule takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll do it after" | After = never. Do it now. |
| "Spirit not ritual" | The ritual IS the spirit. |

## Red Flags - STOP

- [Flag 1]
- [Flag 2]
- "This is different because..."

**All mean:** Delete. Start over.

## Valid Exceptions

- [Exception 1]
- [Exception 2]

**Everything else:** Follow the rule.

```markdown
---
name: pattern-name
description: >-
  Use when [recognizable symptom].
metadata:
  category: pattern
  triggers: complexity, hard-to-follow, nested
---

# Pattern Name

## The Pattern

[1-2 sentence core idea]

## Recognition Signs

- [Sign that pattern applies]
- [Another sign]
- [Code smell]

## Before

\`\`\`typescript
// Complex/problematic
function before() {
  // nested, confusing
}
\`\`\`

## After

\`\`\`typescript
// Clean/improved
function after() {
  // flat, clear
}
\`\`\`

## When NOT to Use

- [Over-engineering case]
- [Simple case that doesn't need it]

## Impact

**Before:** [Problem metric]
**After:** [Improved metric]
```
